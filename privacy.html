                    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">We collect various types of information when you interact with our services, including personal identification information (name, email, phone number), payment details for transactions, technical data about your device and browser, usage information about how you interact with our website, and location data (if you enable this feature). This information helps us provide and improve our services, process transactions, and communicate with you effectively.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">The information we collect serves multiple purposes: to provide and maintain our services, process your transactions and send order confirmations, communicate with you about your account or our services, improve our website and services through analytics, personalize your experience by showing relevant content, send promotional emails (with your consent), detect and prevent fraud or security issues, and comply with legal obligations. We only process your data when we have a legal basis to do so.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating our business (such as payment processors and hosting providers), when required by law or to respond to legal processes, to protect the rights and safety of Plantrix Care and our users, in connection with a business transfer like a merger or acquisition, and with your explicit consent for specific purposes. We require all third parties to respect the security of your data and to treat it in accordance with the law.</p>

                    <h3>4. Data Security Measures</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. These measures include encryption of data in transit and at rest, regular security assessments, access controls to limit who can access your data, staff training on data protection, and incident response plans. While we strive to protect your personal data, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

                <div class="policy-point">
                    <h3>5. Data Retention Periods</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. The specific retention period depends on the nature of the data and the purpose for its collection. For example, transaction data is typically kept for 7 years for tax purposes, while website analytics data may be retained for 2 years. We regularly review our retention periods to ensure we're not keeping data longer than necessary.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Some web browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites that you do not want to be tracked. Currently, there is no industry standard for recognizing or responding to DNT signals, and our website does not respond to them at this time. However, we provide you with choices about the collection and use of your information through our cookie consent tool and privacy settings. We will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of standards.</p>

When we make solely automated decisions that significantly affect you, we will provide meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing. You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing that produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects you, unless it's necessary for a contract with you, authorized by law, or based on your explicit consent.</p>
